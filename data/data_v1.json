They are derived from the summarized information in the 'tax_per_income' and 'social_security_per_income' fields for each location, respectively. Scores reflect a comparative assessment based on factors such as: explicit tax exemptions or special low rates for Digital Nomads (DNs) on foreign-sourced income, territorial vs. worldwide taxation, general income tax rates, mandatory vs. optional social security contributions for DNs, and the availability of exemptions (e.g., if covered by a home country's system via treaty). These scores are intended as a general guideline and are inherently subjective. Tax and social security laws are complex, vary by individual circumstances, and are subject to change; professional advice should always be sought for specific situations. Cost of living, internet, and safety scores are also 1-5 scales based on relative global indices and data available as of the date_of_cost_check."
